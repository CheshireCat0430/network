* What is in this directory? 

  README             this file
  host.c             contains source code of host program
  hub.c              contains source code of hub program
  router.c           contains source code of router program
  utils.c            utilities used by all the programs
  common.h           common macros and function prototypes
  dist-vec.h         header file for distance vector routing protocol
  dist-vec.c         functions for handling distance vector routing protocol
  Makefile.template  template file for generating a Makefile with 'Configure' shell script
                     according to the operating system, such as Linux and SunOS

  host               host executable in Linux
  hub                hub executable in Linux
  router             router executable in Linux

  ip-addr.conf       configuration file for the IP address assignment for hubs, routers, and hosts
  mac-addr.conf      configuration file for the MAC address assignment for routers and hosts
  gateway.conf       configuration file for configuring default gateway at hosts
  

* What do we have to do?

  You have to design and implement the router program with router.c and dist-vec.h. 
  You don't have to touch any other files related to host and hub programs. The template files provide
  you with ARP, DNS functions as well as IP/Ethernet Packet Encapsulation and Decapsulation.
  If you find some bug in host or hub program, let the TA (Bien Aime Mugabarigira, bienaime@skku.edu) know it.

* How do i compile my programs? 

  The 'Makefile.template' is provided just for that purpose. To compile, run

    % Configure
    % make

  It will create 'host', 'hub' and 'router'. 

* How do i run and test my programs? 

  The configuration files conform to the description for Project II.
  You can refer to the document for the commands for each program.

  Our 'host' can be safely executed with './host' since 'host' without prefix './'
  can call the system command 'host', not our 'host'.

  - Example: Single LAN Scenario
    % hub lan1
    % ./host mercury lan1 router1
    % ./host deci lan1 router1

* How do i exit from these programs? 

  You can type Ctrl-C to kill any of the programs.
